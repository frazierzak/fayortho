To ensure your safety and that of your treating providers/team, please <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/index.html">visit this CDC link</a> for information regarding symptoms prior to presenting for a scheduled visit.<br><br>Here at Fayetteville Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine, we are doing our part in reducing exposure and spread of COVID-19. Please be aware that if you wish to enter our office for an appointment, or otherwise, you will be screened in the foyer. This includes a temperature check. This will be the case for anyone who needs to accompany you. With that said, we will limit the amount of traffic through our office. We ask for your understanding if you are asked to wait in your vehicle or outside as our lobby is closed to patient seating. Some people who wish to enter the building with a patient may not be granted access as we, again, wish to keep potential exposure to a minimum. If you have any symptoms of COVID-19, we will reschedule your appointment. Our staff will be happy to assist you. We address each patient individually, ensuring that we are accommodating your specific orthopaedic needs. Fayetteville Orthopaedics is following the recommended CDC guidelines for disinfecting our facility. We appreciate your support in the battle against the spread of COVID-19. </p>

					<h1>History</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="page-header-triangle"></div>
				<img src="images/building3.jpg" />
				<p><strong>Fayetteville Orthopaedic Clinic PA</strong> was founded in 1974 by <strong>Dr. James Askins</strong>. He was later joined by <strong>Dr. Robert Logel</strong> (’76) and <strong>Dr. James Johnson</strong> (’78) at their then new office on Melrose Road.</p>
				<p><strong>Dr. W. Dickson Schaefer</strong> became a partner in 2001, <strong>Dr. Christopher Barnes</strong> joined in 2003, and <strong>Dr. Daniel McBrayer</strong> came on board in 2008.</p>
				<p>Our current office was constructed in 2009 and the practice grew further with the addition of <strong>Dr. Kimberly Barrie</strong> in 2011.</p>
				<p>Presently, <strong>Drs. Schaefer</strong>, <strong>Barnes</strong>, <strong>McBrayer</strong>, and <strong>Barrie</strong> along with <strong>Michael Dilello PAC</strong> provide the Fayetteville Community and the Cape Fear region with the expert, compassionate, professional care it has come to expect over the past four and a half decades.</p>

				<div class="testimonial">
					<p>"I had my second visit to Fayetteville Orthopaedics yesterday. Not one aspect of my visit was less than a 10. The employee at check-in was friendly and professional. She knew her job!</p> 
					<p>I then had x-rays and, again, the staff was professional and I was treated fantastically.</p>
					<p>I saw P.A. Dilello who is more than good. He asks about things like your home situation and everything that could be a problem with your healing. This is generally the least asked question and is one of the most important.  Without a doubt he is the finest PA that I have ever seen.</p>
					<p>I love these people."</p>
