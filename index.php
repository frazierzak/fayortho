					<h1>History</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="page-header-triangle"></div>
				<img src="images/building3.jpg" />
				<p><strong>Fayetteville Orthopaedic Clinic PA</strong> was founded in 1974 by <strong>Dr. James Askins</strong>. He was later joined by <strong>Dr. Robert Logel</strong> (’76) and <strong>Dr. James Johnson</strong> (’78) at their then new office on Melrose Road.</p>
				<p><strong>Dr. W. Dickson Schaefer</strong> became a partner in 2001, <strong>Dr. Christopher Barnes</strong> joined in 2003, and <strong>Dr. Daniel McBrayer</strong> came on board in 2008.</p>
				<p>Our current office was constructed in 2009 and the practice grew further with the addition of <strong>Dr. Kimberly Barrie</strong> in 2011.</p>
				<p>Presently, <strong>Drs. Schaefer</strong>, <strong>Barnes</strong>, <strong>McBrayer</strong>, and <strong>Barrie</strong> along with <strong>Michael Dilello PAC</strong> provide the Fayetteville Community and the Cape Fear region with the expert, compassionate, professional care it has come to expect over the past four and a half decades.</p>

				<div class="testimonial">
					<p>"I had my second visit to Fayetteville Orthopaedics yesterday. Not one aspect of my visit was less than a 10. The employee at check-in was friendly and professional. She knew her job!</p> 
					<p>I then had x-rays and, again, the staff was professional and I was treated fantastically.</p>
					<p>I saw P.A. Dilello who is more than good. He asks about things like your home situation and everything that could be a problem with your healing. This is generally the least asked question and is one of the most important.  Without a doubt he is the finest PA that I have ever seen.</p>
					<p>I love these people."</p>
